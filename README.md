# Todoist Scheduler for Google Calendar  

Takes Todoist items and schedules time for them on your Google Calendar  


## Purpose  

While Todoist does have a Google Calendar integration, it was fairly limited in terms of just adding reminders about things that are going to be due. This might be nice for professionals/people with real jobs, but I'm a student. I have a lot of repeated tasks that are already easy to schedule into Google Calendar. However, I find myself spending too much time planning how I should allocate my time to make sure I finished all my work. This is intended to help streamline and offload that planning process, so I can spend more time getting things done  

## Default Settings  

Currently, I don't have configurable settings (this will probably be the last thing I do). The scheduler will only populate the calendar through the end of the week (Sunday). 


## Finished Features
* Get authorization from Todoist 
* Get a list of tasks from Todoist
* Get OAuth2 authentication from Google  


## Work In Progress
1. Get blocks of time from Google Calendar  
2. Sort tasks by priority and other constraints  
3. Match free blocks of time to tasks  
4. Push task blocks to Google Calendar  
5. Add settings
